* Readme file for Pointers and Array
*/
Pointer is a value that designates the address (i.e., the location in memory), of some value. 
Pointers are variables that hold a memory location.
In computer science, an array data structure, or simply an array, is a data structure consisting of a collection of elements, each identified by at least one array index or key.
